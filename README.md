# 🍔 McDonald's Bill Buddy

**Bill Buddy** is a responsive and visually engaging McDonald's-style billing web app. It replicates the look and feel of a real self-order kiosk at a McDonald's outlet, allowing users to select food and beverage items, input quantities, choose a payment method, and generate a clean itemized bill.
